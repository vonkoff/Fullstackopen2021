actor A
A->browser:
note over A
user creates a new note and submits it
end note 

note over browser:
Event handler immediately calls the method e.preventDefault() 
to prevent the default handling of form submit.
end note
browser->server:POST request https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
note over browser:
Then the event handler creates a new note, 
adds it to the notes list with the command notes.push(note), 
rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server. 
The javascript code executes this so that a url redirect is not necessary.
end note
server-->browser: application/json= {content: "new test part 0 spa note", date: "2020-09-01T00:17:25.239Z"}

note over browser:
The Content-Type header of the request tells the server 
that the included data is represented in the JSON format.
Without this header, the server would not know how to correctly parse the data.
end note
